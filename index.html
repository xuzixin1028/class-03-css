    <section>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      <p>
        We're so excited to share our love of animals with our neighbors, and we hope you come visit soon. Whether you
        stop by once while you're passing through town or come multiple times a week, you'll find the Ithaca Zoo is ready
        to welcome you with open arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Advisory: due to upcoming hot weather, we advise all guests to make sure they bring sunscreen for
          protection from ultraviolet rays and a water bottle to help stay hydrated.</strong> We have water fountains all
        over the zoo where you can fill up. Just look for the signs that say "Watering Hole."

      <h2>Our Animals</h2>

      <p>We host a wide variety of animals in climate-controlled biomes designed to perfectly match their natural
        environments.</p>

      <p>Our many viewing platforms and walkways provide incredible views of our animals but keep guests at a safe
        distance.</p>

      <p>This is to keep you safe from them, and them safe from you.</p>

      <p>However, there are a few animals that are safe for you to feed in supervised sessions.</p>

      <p>Just look for the happy zookeeper sign along edge of the enclosure to learn about the time and location for these
        opportunities.</p>

      <p>
        Jeff, like all giraffes, sleeps very little (&lt; 30 minutes a night) in make sure he is alert &amp; ready to
        avoid predators. No wonder he eats so much every day (&gt; 50 pounds of leaves)!
      </p>
